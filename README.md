### *Space Paradox And Combat Enviroment*

 A tower defence strategy game, created entirely using JavaScript and the Phaser 3 framework. The goal of this project was to create a simple game similar to ones we played when we were young. The criteria we set out for ourselves was simple:
 - Capture the essense of old flash games we played as kids
 - Fully web-based game, in the spirit of those old flash games
 - Use this project as a platform to learn how to create and distribute a web app
